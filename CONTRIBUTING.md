# Contributing

Use [GitHub issues](https://github.com/open-ott-play/ottplay-swop/issues) for non-sensitive bug reports, questions and
feature proposals. Include the exact version/commit, environment, expected and
actual behavior, and a minimal sanitized reproduction. Check existing issues
first and keep follow-up evidence in the original thread. For vulnerabilities,
use the [private security process](SECURITY.md).

Submit a focused pull request against `main`. Describe the user-visible problem,
the resulting behavior, compatibility implications and checks performed. Preserve
existing authorship and third-party license/provenance records. Discuss changes
to protocols, storage, device safety or dependency/runtime requirements before
making an incompatible change. English is the common language for code review
and project documentation.

## Development and validation

```sh
npm ci --ignore-scripts
npm run typecheck
npm test
```

Copy wrangler.toml.example to the ignored wrangler.toml and use dummy account/KV IDs for npm run build (Wrangler dry-run). Production publication belongs to the Terraform process. The Miniflare compatibility override pins sharp 0.35.5 and undici 7.29.1 until the upstream toolchain adopts fixed dependencies.

The [CI workflow](.github/workflows/ci.yml) is the authoritative list of required jobs.
Use isolated test data and temporary outputs. Never run a device write, unlock,
deployment or publication command merely to validate a documentation change.

## Test and review policy

Changes to behavior must add or update automated tests that fail for the old
defect and cover the new boundary; regression fixes should include the relevant
failure case. If automation is infeasible, explain why in the PR and document
the reproducible manual procedure and limits. Update user/API documentation and
release notes for user-visible changes. Keep compiler, lint, static-analysis and
test assertions enabled, resolve new warnings, and document any remaining
warning with its reason and scope. Do not suppress a real security finding to
obtain a passing check. Wait for required checks and independent review before
merging; do not use an administrator bypass.
